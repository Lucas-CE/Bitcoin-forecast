# Bitcoin-forecast

## Motivation
A very interesting property of cryptocurrencies is their volatility, which is why many people start trading cryptocurrencies. In fact, couple of years ago I got into trading, however, I left it without many results due to lack of time. Now I have a lot of knowledge in ML, so I would like to trade based on predictions from various models.

Considering the amount of data, and high volatility in recent years, the study will be based on the bitcoin price in dollars from ~2019, using daily timeframe.


## Problem 1: Trying to predict the price of bitcoin
We want to forecast the bitcoin price using state of art models.


## Problem 2: Classify if in X days the price will increase in Y percentage
With the same trading motivation, a usual question that comes up is whether in X amount of days, the price will manage to go up by Y percentage. 

For this, we propose to solve a binary classification problem, where we try to predict whether in X days, the price will rise by Y percentage.

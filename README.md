# Bitcoin-forecast

## Motivation
A very interesting property of cryptocurrencies is their volatility, which is why many people start trading cryptocurrencies. In fact, couple of years ago I got into trading, however, I left it without many results due to lack of time. Now I have a lot of knowledge in ML, so I would like to trade based on predictions from various models.

Considering the amount of data, and high volatility in recent years, the study will be based on the bitcoin price in dollars from ~2019, using daily timeframe.


## Problem 1: Trying to predict the price of bitcoin
We want to forecast the bitcoin price using state of art models.

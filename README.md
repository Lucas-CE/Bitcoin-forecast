# Bitcoin Forecasting with Deep Learning

## Motivation
Cryptocurrencies are known for their high volatility, making them a fascinating asset for traders. A few years ago, I ventured into cryptocurrency trading but had to step away due to time constraints. Now, armed with substantial knowledge in Machine Learning, I am eager to re-enter the world of cryptocurrency trading by making informed decisions based on predictive models.

Given the wealth of historical data and recent market turbulence, this project focuses on predicting the price of Bitcoin in USD since 2019, using a daily timeframe.

## Key Objectives

### Problem 1: Bitcoin Price Prediction

**File:** btc_classic_forecast.ipynb

Our primary goal is to develop accurate forecasts for Bitcoin's price utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning models. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights for traders and investors.

**Results:**

### Problem 2: Price Trend Classification
To address the trading aspect, we seek to answer a common question: Can we predict whether Bitcoin's price will increase by a certain percentage within a specified timeframe (X days)? This is tackled as a binary classification problem, where our models will predict whether the price will rise by Y percentage in X days.
